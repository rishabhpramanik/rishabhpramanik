Hi, my name is Rishabh Pramanik. Currently I'm switching to IT Field and I chose to pursue my career in software testing. I keep on adding case studies and prjects which were given to us
by my training institute and some project I found on the internet. I have started my journey from learning basic Java. Now, I am try my hand in automation testing and doing pretty good 
in it.
Soon I'll be adding more project related to automation testing and advance Java.
Thanks for visiting my profile.

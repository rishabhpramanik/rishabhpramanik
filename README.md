Hi, my name is Rishabh Pramanik. I am very passionate about how the applications work and how quality application is delivered to customers. So I'm working on manual and automation testing projects which demonstrate my skills in software testing and working on these projects also keeps me up to date from the current market and challenges in maintaining quality application.
I keep on adding case studies and projects which were given to us by my training institute and some project which I personally took to work on. I have started my journey from learning basic Java. Now, I am try my hand in automation testing and doing pretty good in it.
Any suggestion and contribution are always welcome.
Thanks for helping out your fellow tester.
Cheers ! Thanks for visiting my profile.
